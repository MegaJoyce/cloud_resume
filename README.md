## FAQ
Below are some questions or issues I encountered during the backend deployment. I attached the resolution that I found for them. Hope it helps you as well.
1. How to write the JS code?
2. How to do the version control?
3. Why I did not use Azure Pipeline but GitHub Actions instead?
Well I am very eager to use Azure Pipeline beacaue I really need to gone through the whole process of Azure Pipeline. 
However, Azure Pipeline has a machanism named parallel jobs, which is needed to run a job and costs a lot of money. I could not afford so many services. I have ran out of free account quota, so it cost me every penny when I am using Azure Services. Among them, Azure DevOps is the most expensive one. I have to give it up and turn to the very similiar pipeline tool -  GitHub Actions - for FREE!
